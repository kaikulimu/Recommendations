## https://boardgamearena.com/10/arknova?table=492513358#
Move #1
    - Discard Pond Turtle and Release Australia okay?
    - Verify project priority: Species 4 > Habitat 5 > America 5 > Release Australia
Move #18 Choices
    1. Snap `Barn Owl`
    2. Snap `European Grass Snake`
Move #37
    1. (Do Upgraded Build action later in one go) Animals 5 Anaconda -> X-Build -> Sponsor 5XX Polar Bear 
    2. Build 1 [1] -> Animals 5 Anaconda + Barn Owl -> Cards 4 -> Sponsor 5X Polar Bear Exhibit cover 1-rep -> {Sponsor Cards Animals Build Assoc}
Move #51
    1. Sponsor 5XX Polar Bear -> Assoc 5 Species 4 upgrade Build -> Cards 5 snap Rhea -> Build 4 [pav kiosk 1] -> Assoc 3 PZoo upgrade Animals -> Animals 5 Barn Owl -> {Animals Assoc Build Cards Sponsor}
    2. Cards 5X snap Rhea -> Sponsor 5X Polar Bear -> Assoc 5 Species 4 -> …similar
Move #119
    1. Snap Geologist
    2. Snap Northern Giraffe to rush Species 5
Move #134
    Build 5 [2, 1, kiosk, pav] -> Animals 5 Barn Owl + Porcupine dig Lorikeet upgrade Assoc -> Sponsor 5 Geologist -> Cards 5 snap B.R. Howler if Habitat 5 is secure -> Assoc 5 Release Europe or PZoo + 2-rep -> {Assoc Cards Sponsor Animals Build}
        - Build 5 for which two of [Barn Owl, Crested Porcupine, Coconut Lorikeet]?
Post Move #183
    1. Assoc 5 Release Europe donate 2 unlock 2-size -> Build 5 [3, kiosk, pav]
    2. Build 4 [3, 1] -> Assoc 7XX 2-rep Univ + Africa PZoo donate 2 upgrade Cards

## Real-time https://boardgamearena.com/table?table=494311977
Move #8 
    - Do you snap Indian Peafowl or Eagle?
    - Do you take Asia PZoo for Peafowl or Japanese Macaque? Or do you take Europe PZoo to rush Assoc 5 Europe 2?
Move #39
    Very dubious play by you. Were you supposed to stall for Japanese Macaque Pilfer value?
    
## https://boardgamearena.com/14/arknova?table=497799244#
Move #1 Starting Hand:
    Is keeping 3 Afirca animals + Archaeologist the best? Note that Africa PZoo saves you $6 which is almost Archaeologist in early game, and 5-CP Univ becomes more valuable for you!
    It gives you flexibility as you can start take either Africa PZoo or 2-rep Univ on first Assoc action
Move #8 Choices (Critical)
    1. Assoc 4 5-hand Univ -- most likely better because you are not taking the weak Animals 3, and you will only spend one Animals action to play two animals instead of spending two.
    2. Animals 3 Agama sunbathing 2
Move #36 Is what you calculated the best line?
    1. Sponsor 5 Break 5) -> Cards 5 -> Assoc 4 2-rep Univ upgrade Build/Animals -> Build 5 cover 1 rep upgrade Animals/Assoc -> Animals 5 Mamba upgrade Assoc <-> Sponsor 5 Archaeologist {Sponsor<->Animals Build Assoc Cards}
Move #59 (Critical)
    !! Overall, was it okay to stay at Rep_5 and not gain 2nd worker sooner?
    Which action upgrade order is best? 
    Is upgrading Build then Sponsor the best? Remember, you would like to play Cable Car then spam sponsors.
Move #68
    1. Is rep-draw denying Petting Zoo the best play? Should you have lured him into Cards 5 Snap Alpaca?
    2. Was it okay to give up one rep border placement bonus from Archaeologist? You lose out on 1-rep/$5 most likely, but save one X-token from Cable Car
Move #105 (Critical)
    1. Is it better to snap Nile Crocodile or Native Lizards, or even Barn Owl?
    2. Do you do Cards first or Assoc first?
    3. Is this a Reptile House game?
Move #160 Discard choice
    - Do you discard Alpaca because you don't even care that you might snap a 2nd Petting Zoo for denial?
    - Do you keep Sea Turtle Tank to abuse Sunbathing and look to fill map?
    - Do you keep Waza Small for flexibility between it and Sea Turtle Tank?
Before Move #193
    - Should you have unlocked worker + Snap Adventure Playground instead?
Before Move #205 When build Reptile House:
    1. Was $5 from Archaeologist better than X?
    2. Should you have migrated 1-cube reptile, and from 2-size near water for Platypus instead of rock?    
Move #239
    1. Was it better to upgrade Assoc over Cards? You can donate $2/5/7/... and unlock PZoo for an endgame pt becomes possibility.
    2. Should you have instead taken American PZoo to plan for American Alligator + Giant Tortoise?
Move #257 (Critical)
    1. Which card to snap? `Zoo School` or `Barred Owl Hut` or `Fennec Fox` or `American Alligator`?
    2. What's your next Build action going to look like? Do you have time to fill map?
        - Since it's unlikely you end next Round, you will have lots of income so it's worth building a 5 for potential elephant
        - Build 5 and not playing Sea Turtle Tank is the most flexible line
    3. Which sponsors do you plan to play next, given oppo will likely break in 3-4 turns?
Move #286 Which move is best?
    (8 turns)
    1. Cards 5 -> Assoc 5 -> Animals 5 Clever? -> Build 5 -> Sponsor 5 -> Cards 5 -> Assoc 5 -> Animals 5 -> {Animals_play_max_4_prob_lack_money Assoc Cards Sponsor Build}
        - Cards 5 Snap European Bison or Cards 5 draw 3

    (8 turns, Cards 5 gain X, put Animals before Cards Assoc)
    2. Animals 3 Platypus -> Cards 5 -> Assoc 5 -> Build 5 -> Sponsor 5 -> Animals 5 Clever? -> Cards 5 -> Assoc 5 -> {Assoc Cards Animals_play_max_3 Sponsor Build}

    (9 turns, induces oppo to Sponsor 2 BREAK 2, put Animals and Sponsor before Cards Assoc, risk losing European Bison)
    3. Animals 3 Platypus -> Sponsor 2 Orinthologist || Sponsor 3X Zoo School -> Cards 5 -> Assoc 5 -> Build 5 -> Animals 5 Clever? -> Sponsor 5 -> Cards 5 -> Assoc 5 -> {Assoc Cards Sponsor Animals_play_max_3 Build}
Move #351 Choices
    1. Sponsor 5X Zoo School + Quarantine Lab -> Animals 3 Common Wall Lizard + Zebra -> Assoc 8XXX Europe 5 + America PZoo ~> END 131pt
    2. Assoc 5X Europe 5 ~> END 109pt
        - If you had ended here, you would have lost if oppo has 6CP endgame, draw if 5CP endgame
    3. Sponsor 5X Zoo School + Quarantine Lab -> Assoc 8XXX Europe 5 + America PZoo ~> END 121pt
Move #372 Choices
    - Is it true that Ultra Slow is always better than Slow because it counters Species endgame and the 1pt loss is meaningless?
    - Ultra slow is good vs Species, good vs generic 5CP, bad vs Conservation.
    1. (ultra slow) Animals 3 Common Wall Lizard + Zebra -> Animals 2 Stoat -> Assoc 8XXX Europe 5 + America PZoo ~> END 134pt -3oppo_endgame_if_Species
    2. (slow) Animals 3 Common Wall Lizard + Zebra -> Assoc 8XXX Europe 5 + America PZoo ~> END 131pt
    3. (fast) Assoc 8XXX Europe 5 + America PZoo ~> END 121pt
    

https://boardgamearena.com/10/arknova?table=498183637#    
Afer Move #198 
    Architectural Zoo or Conservation Zoo?
        - Given you will unlock 2-size and you have Meerkat Den, Architectural Zoo 2CP seems more doable
Move #224
    Review at END: Did you have the luxury to greed donate $12? And would you have time to donate $12 sufficient times anyways?
    
    
https://boardgamearena.com/table?table=510660091
END Please do a breakdown of all endgame points and where they come from!

https://boardgamearena.com/14/arknova?table=520504637
Move #1 Starting Hand
    - Keep [Primatologist, Explorer, Science Lab] and Fur Seal or Mangabey?
    1. Mangabey
        - "Determination" Cards, though you delay it after Build -> Animals
        - Enables Primates 2
        - Closer to rush REP_5 Univ and REP_8 PZoo
        - Close to cover free PZoo, which might already be worth a free worker
        - Potential to have a super long Round 1 and spam Sponsors
    2. Fur Seal
        - Free worker is great
        - Likely get to 3rd upgrade faster
        - Not upgrading Build helps with Naturalist Zoo, but you really want to upgrade Build on this map
        - bad: Forced to upgrade Animals, while upgrade Build + Sponsor might be more ideal
        - bad: Lose $6 on first break
        - bad: No project completion in sight
        - bad: far away from free PZoo
Move #105 Sponsor 4X Explorer -> Animals 5 Sec Bird
    - Was it worth spending 1 X to gain 1ap from Explorer? It does hit the 15ap income mark
Move #125 Discard choice
    - Was discarding Muskox better than Expert Pred?
        - Muskox requires Americas PZoo, and has low money-to-appeal ratio
        - Expert Pred triggers Explorer, so it's at least $5 + 1ap
        - Since you are going heavy on Birds, probably no time for Herbivores 4, not to mention oppo can block and can gain value via Expert Herb
Move #151 Was it fine to X-Animals?
    - Oppo will have to waste a turn too
    - Enables Sponsor 4X Science Lab before break
Move 154 When you played Science Lab
    - Should you have drawn Sloth Bear?
      - It does have Bear icon for Explorer, and fits Asia PZoo and Expert Pred
      - Boost Assoc can be very strong 
      - Fits nicely into 1-size for Outdoor Areas
      - bad: I was trying to find project after Birds 5
    - Inspect how much value Science Lab provided for the entire game (don't forget it gives one Scienc icon to enable other sponsors)
Move #196 Build Spots Selection
    - Should you have built 1-size for Common European Adder or Euro Pond Turtle (might be gone) instead?
        - I am trying to greed for one more pav and see what happens
    - Should you have drawn Euro Pond Turtle to trigger Explorer value?
        - No, because enabling Cards 5 draw Common Agama + Barbary Macaque + 2 for opppo is too dangerous
        - Morever, Barbary Macaque gets oppo closer to Primates 5
        - Also, you won't have enought money to play it this round
    - Was allowing oppo Cards 5 Euro Pond Turtle + Common Agama okay?
        - I think Barbary Macaque is more dangerous
Move #221 Peafowl pav cover rep-draw choices (interesting)
    1. Draw Euro Pond Turtle
        - Trigger Explorer, better than Euro Adder, which requires Europe PZoo and gives less value due to wasted Hypnosis
        - Near good for animal to play along with Ostrich. Moreover, you will only have ~$10 left, or ~$5 if oppo does play Barbary Macaque
        - Next Build 5 containing 1-size seems logical and efficient
        - bad: There are other opportunities to trigger Explorer, though the END is not far
    2. Draw Waza Large
        - Waza Large has a very unique effect, thus not easily replaceable
        - Since you will have loads of money, you might like to squeeze in another large animal
        - bad: Since you have single worker, you want to Sponsor N BR 2N a lot, you will have loads of money and you won't have time to play Waza Large for quite some time
        - bad: You have Naturalist Zoo vs Small Animals Zoo
        - bad: You still need a bit of time before REP_6 requirement
    3. Do not cover rep-draw
        - You need project after Birds 5
        - You want 6th Bird
        - Less likely to have to discard cards after break, though Euro Adder can be discarded carefree
        - bad: You have unlocked snap, Science Lab and Ostrich to help you draw cards later on, prioritize near good cards
        - bad: No point in denying Barbary Macaque since oppo can Animals 5U REP_10 draw it anyways
        - bad: Does not leave a 2-size slot @d6d7
Move #242 Was Cards 5 draw 3 better than snapping Gray Langur or Owl Hut
    - If very ahead, play safe. If very behind, gamble more.
        - The only way you lose is if you *never* draw another project, which is ~25-40% given 8-12 more draws
    - Since you likely Sponsor 3 BR 3 BREAK anyways, you can snap Gray Langur next turn
        - GTO verify: Cards 5 draw 3 then snap Gray Langur at BREAK is better than snap Gray Langur then snap a new display card at BREAK
    - If you play Owl Hut, you might get into an awkward situation where Naturalist Zoo and fill map are both bad for you
    - You can top-deck great cards like White Rhino and Hydrologist (which you did this game!)
Move #303 Build choices
    1. Build 5 [pav @g5, 1 @6 near water for Euro Pond Turtle cover draw?, 2 near Outdoor Areas and rock for Rhino cover X]
        - Aims to complete Naturalist Zoo and Hydrologist endgame
    2. Build to cover Clever
        - bad: Can't play Euro Pond Turtle this round; and if you play Ostrich + Rhino you are vulnerable to Barbary Macaque pilfering
Move #314 Choices
    1. Assoc 4XX 2-Science Univ still donate $2 CP_8 Americas PZoo -> Animals 5 -> Sponsor 4 
        - Claiming CP_8 Americas PZoo is worth the 2 Xs spent
        - Stealing $2 donation from oppo, esp. when oppo has low income. Nerfs their CP_8 $10 reward
    2. Animals 5 -> Sponsor 4 
        - Saves 2 Xs
        
https://boardgamearena.com/9/arknova?table=520544496
Move #19 Choices
    - Important: Other than Cards 5 drawing something new, only difference will be in action sequencing if you don't take 5-hand Univ
    - Do Cards before Build only if no Hullbreaker threat
    - Take Asia PZoo over Americas PZoo to save $3 on Dusky-Leaf Monkey
    1. Assoc 3 PZoo -> Build 2 cover PZoo <-> Cards 5 -> Animals 5 Dusky-Leaf Monkey Clever?
    2. Build 2 cover PZoo -> Assoc 4 PZoo <-> Cards 5 -> Animals 5 Dusky-Leaf Monkey Clever?
    3. Cards 5 draw 3 -> Assoc 4 PZoo -> Build 2 cover PZoo -> Animals 5 Dusky-Leaf Monkey Clever?
        - Bad: Vulnerable to Hullbreaker
Move #44 Choices
    1. Cards 5 draw 3
        - Potential for Americas/Asia/Primate icon
        - Have backup plans to play animals if you draw blank
        - Can X-back Animals to enable Assoc 7XX if needed
        - Can draw good sponsors/projects
    2. Cards 5 snap A.F. Tortoise
        - Only wastes one space if you Build 2 [2 near Outdoor Areas cover X] -> Assoc 7XX PZoo + Univ
        - 1CP helps save donate $5 for CP_2 upgrade
        - Sunbathing is excellent
Move #54 Choices
    1. Sponsor 3 Water Playground -> Build 3 [3]
    2. Sponsor 5 BR 5 BREAK discard 1
Move #217 Which cards to draw?
    - `Malayan Tapir` doesn't matter because if oppo does Release Herb with it, it enables us to release Elephant. And oppo has an Elephant already.
Move #231 Assoc 5 Bird Breeding unlock bonus
    1. $5 to play Elephant next round
        - Enables you to play Expert Pred and then Marten + Elephant next Round, which gives Hunter 2 + Hunter 1 + Hunter 3, potentially giving your 4 Primates or good Predator like `Lion`
            - Also helps with Species and Sponsors endgame from elephant
        - If oppo Assoc 4 2-Science Univ 2x on Sponsor, we can break immediately to punish
        - If oppo Sponsor 2 buy Guided School Tours, CP_5 2x might be awkward for him to grab
        - (In really, oppo did Build 3 [3 near Outdoor Areas cover X]...)
    2. Snap Guided School Tours
Move #252 Build location
    - Was the Build [1 near kiosk, ...] optimal to potentially greed one more kiosk income?
        - Yes, because you are far from fill map, and have time to fill the holes if need be
Move #275 Card to keep from Hunter 3
    - Was `Giant Panda` better keep than `Rock Monitor`?
        - Yes because oppo only has $3 and would like to break soon
Move #292 Was keeping Conservation Zoo better than Climbing Park? 

https://boardgamearena.com/table?table=522554724
Move #1 Is it okay to discard B.S. Caiman and Native Seabirds?
    - B.S. Caiman
        - If you go for Europe 5 and Habitat 4/5, might never have time for Reptile 4
        - B.S. Caiman has low ap-per-money ratio -> not good for early game
    - Native Seabirds:
        - Likely only 2ap if we play it this round, and dubiously 3endpt
        - You can Cards or cover H to get other playable sponsors
Move #5 Verify that Cards 5 snap Quarantine Lab -> Sponsor 5 Quarantine Lab -> Assoc 4 5-hand Univ is the best way to rush REP_8 worker with Spokesperson
Move #28 **Move of the Century!**
    - Verify: Sponsor 2 BR2 (+1X +$2) ~> BREAK (+$6) -> Assoc 4XX 2-rep Univ upgrade Build (+2rep) -> Build 5 [2, 1, pav, kiosk] cover rep and H or rep-draw, REP_5 upgrade Animals (+1H? +1rep +1ap -$10 +K$$1 +$$$1) -> Animals 5U Barn Owl + Tas Devil pouch 1 (-1H +2-rep 9ap -$23 +K$$2 +$$$6) -> Cards 5 (BR2 +1-2H) -> Sponsor 5 Spokesperson REP_8 worker (-1H +1rep) -> Assoc 4 PZoo ~> {Assoc Sponsor Cards Animals Build BR2 3-5H 0X 8-rep 11ap 0CP =-3pt $0 $$$16}
Move #56 2-size from Build 5: Why did you cover draw B.R. Howler?
    - If cards from Barn Owl are good, pouch B.R. Howler. And if they are bad, keep B.R. howler in hand
    - You want plenty of cards to Sunbathing for Chinese Water Dragon
    - B.R. Howler enables a path to rush Habitat 5, together with Chinese Water Dragon + Africa PZoo
    - bad: You only have one cover draw this entire game
Move #73 Perception keep choice: Llama vs Lesser Flamingo
    - *Observations*
        - If oppo advances break, Spokesperson will be discarded. Else, it will be played. Thus, does not matter much to our current choice.
        - If oppo delays break, you get so much value from 2nd worker that you might win anyways. Thus, focus on the worse case.
        - You might play Euro Bison soon, which requires 5-size
        - Your later actions differ in whether you play Expert Asia or Sponsor N BR N, and whether you sunbathe one or two cards with Chinese Water Dragon
        - You have Quarantine Lab protection
    - Llama
        - Allows you to play Expert Asia
        - Since it costs less, you have more flexibility on whether to advance break. To maintain your 2nd worker advantage, you can delay break
        - Llama doesn't require near water, so you can build 2-size to cover H for better sunbathing candidate
            - If the sponsors are too good, you may even delay playing Chinese Water Dragon
    - Lesser Flamingo
        - Although Lesser Flamingo is more efficient on paper, you are giving up Build efficiency (?) and some good sponsors cards (not to mention Sponsored Zoo). Thus, you actually lose value overall
        - If you sell 2 cards, allows you to build kiosk and pav
        - bad: If you want to play Lesser Flamingo, you might need to Sponsor 5 BR 5, but you want to delay break given you will have 2 workers.
Move #122 Choices
    1. Cards 3 draw 2 discard 1 -> Sponsor 3 BR3
        - Really want a project, or a reptile; else, you might have a wasted Assoc action two rounds later!
        - Fish for 5th Europe animal
        - Fish for OP animals or sponsors
        - Expert Asia slightly bad for Naturalist Zoo
        - Due to low income, you might unlock $5 over snap, making you more inclined to draw cards now
        - bad: European Bison is a nutted animal
        - bad: Chinese Water Dragon and Llama are bascially nutted animals
        - bad: You want to keep Science Lab in case you can upgrade Sponsors
        - bad: You will gave upgraded Cards soon, so no worry
    2. X-Cards -> Sponsor 3 BR3
        - X token is always nice

    - Was discarding Northern Giraffe better than Expert Asia?
        - If you upgrade Sponsors especially, Expert Asia is very useful
Move #168 Assoc 5 unlock choice (Critical)
    - $$$5
        - Your income is low
        - If oppo likely play Zoo School + Mountain Tapir for CP_2 worker => Advance BREAK => $$$5 is better than $12
        - You can do many Sponsor/Assoc/Cards actions before ever having to do Build => not desparate for $12 yet
        - More efficient unlock order if you do unlock $12 later
    - $12
        - bad: Similar to $$$5, but slightly worse in almost all lines
    - 2-size
        - neut: More gambling line. Might have wasted 2-line and not enough money
        - bad: Hurts Naturalist Zoo and Native Farms endgame
    - snap
        - You are desparate for 5th Europe or 2nd Reptile or new project
        - neut: CP_8 draw 3 is a bail-out option if you have really bad cards
        - bad: There are no good cards to snap immediately => waste one snap
        - bad: Euro Bison might grab Aquarium anyways
        - bad: Oppo doesn't have upgraded Cards yet => more difficult for him to grab Aquarium
        - bad: You are about to Cards 5 draw 4 => will have to discard one more card
        - bad: You already have Science Lab in hand, which can trigger Spokesperson REP_10 draw
    - worker
        - bad: If oppo likely play Zoo School + Mountain Tapir for CP_2 worker => Advance BREAK => worker not needed yet
        - bad: Else, oppo has a useful Assoc action sitting at 5, and you can even Assoc 2 2rep
    > btw, why upgrade Sponsor over Assoc?
        - If oppo likely play Zoo School + Mountain Tapir for CP_2 worker => Advance BREAK => gain 5 more money with upgraded Sponsor
        - Allows you to play Science Lab, which triggers Spokesperson
        - Combos with Hollywood Hills
        - Your income is low, won't donate much to Assoc probably
        - Euro Bison might bring you more sponsors to play
Move #193 Was discard `Expert Pred` better than `African Spurred Tortoise`?
Move #205 Choices
    > Read: Did he upgrade Cards before Animals to snap `Eurasian Brown Bear`? Given oppo has `South American Coati`
    > Read Oppo Action: 
        1. Cards 3 snap `Eurasian Brown Bear` -> Sponsor 3 BR 3 BREAK -> Assoc 5 Habitat 4
        2. Sponsor 5XXX BR 5 BREAK -> Assoc 5 Habitat 4
        3. Cards 3 snap `Eurasian Brown Bear` -> Sponsor 3 play sponsor
    1. Assoc 2 2-rep draw Aquarium -> Sponsor 5 Native Farms
        - Most efficient way to utilize Assoc action if oppo delays break => induces oppo to Sponsor 5XXX BR 5 BREAK
        - Deters oppo from stalling with Sponsor 2 play sponsor
        - Deny oppo Cards 3 from snap Aquarium possibility
    2. Sponsor 5 Native Farms -> Assoc 3 2-rep draw Aquarium
        - bad: Oppo will be super happy to do Cards 3 snap `Eurasian Brown Bear` or Aquarium
    3. Sponsor 5 BR 5 BREAK
        - bad: only line that does not postpone oppo Assoc action
    > Assoc 2 2-rep draw Aquarium or not?
        - Yes, because oppo might want to go for super long round with Cards 3 snap Aquarium -> Sponsor 3 Aquarium
        - Aquarium is potentially 11pt, and oppo might be lacking project anyways
Move #222 Verify discard Aquarium
    - It hurts both Naturalist Zoo and Native Farms endgame
Move #224 Choices (Critical)
    > Review how good Eurasian BB was for oppo
    1. Build 5 [3, pav cover H] -> Cards 5X -> Animals 5U A.S. Tortoise sell 3 || Sponsor 3 Science Lab -> Assoc 5 Reptiles 2 -> Sponsor 5X? Science Lab + ?? -> Build 5 cover Clever down Cards -> Animals 5U Euro Bison + Red Deer
        - A.S. Tortoise sunbathes your excess cards
            - Minimize "wasted" drawn cards
        - A.S. Tortoise allows Reptiles 2, especially when you can't END yet and you have insufficient projects
        - Best way to play if oppo delays BREAK
            - Can do twice Build and Animals actions this round => less pressure to cause BREAK => Can play more sponsors
        - Clevers down Cards 5 when you already have 4-6H
        - Denies Eurasian BB if oppo no snap
        - Sneaking in Sponsor 3 Science Lab before Animals 5U is nice, if oppo doesn't threaten BREAK
        - Induces oppo into trying Europe 5
        - Later, you have flexibility to Build 4/5 and sacrifice 3endpt from Native Farms
        - Assoc 5 after Cards 5 allows you to decide Naturalist Zoo vs Sponsored Zoo better
        - bad: Delays Europe 5, but highly unlikely oppo can rush it
        - bad: Locks yourself into Reptiles 2, but also blocks oppo Reptiles 2
    2. Build 6X [pav, 5 cover H] -> Animals 5U Euro Bison + Red Deer || Sponsor 3X Scienc Lab -> Cards 5 -> Assoc 5 Europe 5 -> Sponsor 5X? Science Lab + ??
        - Cards 5 after playing Euro Bison gives you fresher draws
        - Assoc 5 after Cards 5 allows you to decide Naturalist Zoo vs Sponsored Zoo better
        - bad: gives oppo Eurasian BB
    3. Cards 3 draw Reindeer + Eurasian BB -> Build 6X [pav, 5 cover H] -> Sponsor 3 Science Lab -> Animals 5U REP_13 draw Euro Bison + Red Deer -> Assoc 5 Europe 5 ~> {Assoc Animals Sponsor Build Cards BR2 8-9H 2X 15rep 38ap 13CP =53pt $13 K$$6 $$$27}
        - Guarantee to deny Eurasian BB
        - Sequences Sponsor ahead of Animals and Cards
        - bad: not drawing much => might not get project
Move #239 4th draw of Cards 5 draw 4: Should it be Tech Institute?
    - Prevents oppo from getting it
    - You might play Sponsor 3 Science Lab draw deck next turn, to avoid sunbathing Tech Institute with A.S. Tortoise. But you risk not using worker before BREAK, at oppo's cost of not playing animals this round
Move #253 Choices (Critical)
    1. Animals 5U A.S. Tortoise sell 3 sponsors [??]
        - **Card Prophylaxis**: You rather want [Baboon Rock, Cable Car, Gala Tortorise, Reindeer] than [Baboon Rock, Cable Car, Herpetologist, Expert Small or Tech Institute, Vet?]
        - Potentially you can skip a Cards action to fish for animals
        - Red Deer + Gala Tortoise, along with Assoc 5 Europe 5, will get you to 94+ pts
        - Saves you spaces for Naturalist Zoo + Native Farms
        - Consider Gala Tortoise Sunbathe 4 to allow you to play another 2-size animal, if you have enough $$...
        - bad: It's easier to replace Red Deer + Gala Tortoise
        - bad: $48 cost to play Red Deer + Gala Tortoise is difficult to meet
        - bad: Gala Tortoise sunbathe 4 could be wasted, __but__ not if you plan to play another 2-size animal this round
        - bad: leaves Frilled Lizard on display, __but__ oppo slightly more likely to aim for Europe 5
    2. Animals 5U A.S. Tortoise sell Gala Tortoise + ??
        - Aim to play a slow sponsor-spam strategy
        - bad: You will have no animals in hand
        - bad: If the game ends too soon, you won't have enough time to play all the sponsors
Move #274 Choice to unlock with Assoc 5
    1. snap Bamboo Forest
        - You gain a well-needed project, and it's a 10pt one that also gives you an empty 5-size
        - If oppo BREAK in 2 turns, you need to discard two cards instead of one. But if you discard Reindeer, you might as well discard Gala Tortoise, so it doesn't matter that much
    2. $12
        - If oppo delays BREAK, which is less likely, prevents awkwardness to Sponsor 1 BR 1 because you are $2 short to play Euro Bison and Red Deer
    3. worker
        - You are basically begging oppo to BREAK
        - bad: If you lose Bamboo Forest, you might never have another project to do...
    4. 2-size
        - bad: Unlock snap Bamboo Forest for a Euro Bison release might be strictly better
Move #280 Verify: Keeping Naturalist Zoo was better than Sponsored Zoo
Move #299 Verfiy: Correct to discard Reindeer + Gala Tortoise
    - You will release Euro Bison to have empty 5-size

https://boardgamearena.com/9/arknova?table=530224307
Move #1 Starting Hand
    - Was it correct to keep Explorer over Ostrich?
        - Since you will likely do Bird 2, Ostrich might be worthless
        - Ostrich with Sprint 2 selling for $6 is $24 for 8pt if you don't build Aviary; not that good
Move #9 Verify: snap guaranteeing Native Farms is worth risky 5-hand Univ stolen
Move #20 Verify: Build 5 [4 for Pelican cover rep]  is better than Build 5 [1 for Lessser Bird-of-P connect Harbor]
    - Covering rep allows you to gain REP_5 upgrade slightly faster, and you can potentially do one more upgraded action
    - Can take Build at lower strength for building 1-size later
Move #57 Cards 5 draw Tapir + Science Museum + 2 || Sponsor 4 Explorer
Move #76 Verify selling American Bison was okay, due to Explorer anti-synergy; and forced to play another American animal; and oppo can threaten BREAK
Move #92 Verify Cards 3 snap Owl Hut better than Sponsor 3X Orni
    - Trying to rush Birds 4 so you need Barn Owl Hut
    - Also deny oppo Birds 4 and Penguin Pool value
    - "Animals 5 Lesser Bird-of-P" will clever down Build, and this sequencing boosts Cards up 1
Move #129 Choices
    1. Animals 5 Lesser Bird-of-P pav cover clever down Build -> Cards 4 -> Sponsor 5X Owl Hut -> Assoc 5 Birds 4
        - Can more comfortably unlock snapping over $5
    2. Build 2 [2] -> Animals 5 Mountain Tapir + Lesser Bird-of-P pav cover clever down Cards -> Sponsor 5X Owl Hut trigger Orni -> Assoc 5 Birds 4
        - Wins CP_5 Univ, but not even too good, and oppo might not have 5th Species icon
        - Oppo will suffer if he gain CP_5 rep-draw 3 and he does not have 5-hand Univ
        - Animals 5 will do 2 animals at once
        - Build 2 [2] and not upgrading Build might lead to Naturalist Zoo 3CP + Native Farms 2-3CP, given you don't really need kiosks that much
        - bad: If oppo has second animal to play, he might win CP_5 Univ regardless
        - bad: Mountain Tapir wasted digging
        - bad: loses out on Native Lizards value
        - bad: Clevers down Cards instead of Build
        - bad: X-Animals can happen)
        - bad: If you plan to upgrade Build, then Build 2 [2] is inefficient

Move #1 Starting Hand: [Polar Bear Exhibit, Native Seabirds, Low Mountain Range, Bird Breeding]
    - Discard Petting 
        - Does not fit any base project
        - Highly prefer to play a bird
        - No Species base project => Petting is worse
        - bad: Donkey has Inventive
        - bad: No early game animal => Can't stargaze
    - Discard Pond Turtle
        - Does not fit any base project
        - Highly prefer to play a bird
        - bad: No early game animal => Can't stargaze
Move #9 Verify: Your read that oppo is extremely unlikely to deny Thorny Devil
Move #16 Was selling Bird Breeding better than Release Birds
    - If you get a Bird next round, you can do Build N -> Animals N -> Assoc 5 Release Bird unlock worker
        - You wanna upgrade Cards early => four upgrades earlier is good
    - You are not forced to take Americas or Europe PZoo if you get a Bird from that continent
    - bad: If oppo Cinerous Vulture, he can leech!
Move #54 Verify: Cards 5 draw 3 instead of snapping Release Australia or Release Reptile
    - **Abundance Theory**
    - Release Australia and Release Reptile are both there. Unlikely for both to be gone. And their combo rarity ain't too high anyways
    - Gain $3 as a backup on Harbor
    - Might can delay playing Native Seabirds later for more value
    - Might can delay playing Rhino, as long as you still can play Habitats 5 at an opportune moment
Move #88 Verify: Worth it to "X-Cards -> Build 6X" to secure Release Australia
    - Release Australia is super good for you
    - X-Cards boost up Sponsor and Assoc
Move #121 Verify: 5-hand Univ > Asia PZoo > Africa PZoo

https://boardgamearena.com/6/arknova?table=535869693#
Move #1 Starting Hand: [Red Deer, Science Lab, Basic Research, Engineer]
    - `Engineer` is more important because your Cards is at Strength 2, so you can't snap into playing sponsor
    - `Primate Breeding` only has 30% to find a suitable Primate on display
    - `Dugong` via Hullbreaker to rush all-in is likely not worth it
    - `Common Wall Lizard` job can kinda be replaced by `Engineer`
Move #3 Choices
    !! You blundered since Koala needs to be next to Rock
    1. Build 3 [3 draw Koala] -> Assoc 3 Australia PZoo -> Cards 5 draw 2 -> Animals 4 Koala pouch 2 <-> Sponsor 5 Engineer || Sponsor 5 BR5 BREAK (-1H) -> {Sponsor Animals Cards Assoc Build BR2 3H 0X 2rep 12ap 0CP =-2pt $1 K$$0 $$$13} -> Build N [kiosk, kiosk] -> ... -> Animals N Red Deer -> Assoc 5 Herbivores 2 unlock worker?, CP_2 upgrade Sponsors or Build -> ... Asoc 3 PZoo upgrade Sponsor or Build
        - Koala buffs Basic Research, Climbing Park, and Red Deer flocking
        - Enables Herbivores 2
        - You have insane appeal advantage
        - Can do Sponsors earlier if oppo plays sponsor
        - bad: delays Sponsor by a lot
    2. Sponsor 4 Engineer -> Assoc 4 5-hand Univ or 2rep Univ -> Build 3 [3 cover rep] -> Cards 5 snap Foreign Institute? -> Animals 5 Red Der -> {Animals Cards Build Assoc Sponsor BR2 3H 0X 3rep 5ap 0CP =-9pt $7 K$$0 $$$10} -> (?) Build 3 [kiosk, pav, pav]
        - bad: You still need to upgrade Animals for REP_8 worker, but you wanted to upgrade Sponsors and Build
Move #124 Do you go for Release Pred or Herbivores 2
    - If you do Release Pred, your income will be too low
Move #~=180 Koala pouch 1 only, was it okay, to keep options open?
Move #204 Assoc 5 should you unlock snap Geological?

https://boardgamearena.com/14/arknova?table=537310719
Move #1 Starting Hand: [Meerkat Den, Malayan Tapir, NZ Sea Lion, Expert Africa]
    - Flexibility: either rush REP_8 with [Meerkat Den, Malayan Tapir], or rush Predators 2 with [NZ Sea Lion]
    - Keep `NZ Sea Lion`, else you might have a very hard time doing 1st project
    - Discard `Pelican` because `NZ Sea Lion` is easier to play, and Predators 2 is easier 1st project to support
    - Discard `Hydrologist` because water spaces are sacrce in ICP; and you want to leave water spaces open for late game
    - Discard `Horse` even though near good, because if you start 2rep Univ you don't need Horse rep; if you start 5-hand you can afford to keep `NZ Sea Lion` for late game.
        - Also, you would already be at 10ap, so ap rush is less important
Move #22 Was snapping Eagle okay?
    - Post-Mortem: You ended up discarding Eagle anyways...
    - Do not be afriad of Hullbreaker if you can afford to discard. Improving your hand is better than taking an X.
    - Eagle fits the Birds base project. `Malayan Tapir` Digging 3 and prioritized Cards action will give you Near Good back.
    - Eagle could have been very good for oppo
    - bad: Allows oppo Hullbrekaer
    - bad: You sacrifice Near Good for Future Good.
    - bad: Are you too greedy and gambling? Should you have secured Near Good instead?
Move #92 Verify: 5-hand Univ > 2-Science Univ for GF Research
    - You will likely draw to 4 cards, so avoiding one discard is nice
    - You also don't want to be at REP_9 without Cards upgraded
Move#144 Verify draw 3 is better than snap Giant Panda
    - **Knowledge is power**
    - You can draw Panda next round easily
    - Panda difficult for oppo to deny
    - Giant Panda is future good and you embrace open future
    - You might want to draw a sponsor to play
Move #146 Verify discard `Wolf` is okay
    - `NZ Sea Lion` synergizes with `Aquarium`
    - `Northen Giraffe` synergizes with `Meerkat Den`
    - You are in need to have projects to do soon => likely will have to do Predators at 2
Move #189 Verify discard Herpetologist is okay

https://boardgamearena.com/14/arknova?table=539949404#
Move #1 Verify your `Fur Seal -> Predator Breeding -> Africa 5` sequence is so strong that you can discard both `Science Museum` and `GF Research`
After Move #1 Verify passing `Expert Asia` due to 3-hand-size limit is okay
Move #27 Verify snap `A.S. Tortoise` works out for you
    
https://boardgamearena.com/10/arknova?table=538771834#
Move #3 Verfiy: Cards 5 draw 3 is better than snapping Spokesperson
    - `Spokesperson` route does not allow you to do Americas 2 next round
    - **Near Good**: draw more animals to rush Species 5 please
    - Also, `GF Research` has been discarded so Science icons are worse
    - bad: Cannot utilize `Medical Breakthrough` from display, but snapping twice in early game really limits your options
        - Investigate: Were you wrong? Was `Spokesperson` + `Medical Breakthrough` Gemini simply too strong? But I still believe appeal + project of **Holy Trinity** is stronger
Move #42 Verify: Good that `Cable Car` did not cover Clever
Move #54 Is Cards 5 draw 3 better than snap `Science Lab`?
    > Post-Mortem: Very worth: you got `Golden Eagle`, `Sumatran Tiger`, and `Koala`
    > Snap `Science Lab` over `Medical Breakthrough`, because it gives immediate benefits, and it also helps yourself rather than pure denial
    - Near Good for any animal to play
    - Near Good for Species 5
    - Oppo might snap `Medical Breakthrough` first, in which case you still have decent chance to deny `Science Lab`
    - Oppo X-Animals when there is empty 2-size => if he snap `Science Lab`, his Animals game might be too weak
    - bad: `Science Lab` helps him a lot, and if he is strong he will snap it over `Medical Breakthrough`. But he is only <200 Elo mini-smurf
Move #67 Verify discarding `Expert Africa`
Move #87 Verify discarding `Sumatran Tiger`
    - `Golden Eagle` synergizes with `Cable Car` and allows aviary synergy => good when you will likely be drawing from deck
    - Keeping both `Sumatran Tiger` and `Golden Eagle` costs too much, and clogs your hand when your hand size is 3
Move #113 Verify Build cover clever down Animals is correct
    - You save a X from doing Assoc 3X Australia PZoo
    - Clever down Animas from 5 boosts *every* action up 1
    - You def won't play another animal after Koala this round
Move #119.a Verify not snapping `Basic Research` due to anti-synergy with Koala pouching and going over 25 appeal
    - Also, you get to see 4 more cards privately
Move #119.b Verify upgrade Cards is good for you 
Move #131 Should you snap `Japanese Macaque` to pouch it instead of drawing 4?
    - `Japanese Macaque` is very strong for oppo => worth denying as **Near Good**
      - Oppo already has 5 cards => oppo likely to snap it
      - `Japanese Macaque` can solve low income issue for oppo
    - Playing `Foreign Institute` will give up 2X and $5 => okay to pouch it
    - You have decent chance to draw `Ostrich` to play into aviary, or simply draw into other playable animals
    - Assoc 5 Species 5 will likely unlock snapping, so cards is less of an issue for you
    - bad: You only draw one card instead of three
Move #161 Verify not rushing Assoc 5 Jungle is correct
    - You need REP_8 worker (can't even gain from 3rd PZoo) => not skipping Univs
    - You must upgrade Animals to play Eagle => not skipping Univs
    - 2 Univs will be 2 upgrades not 1
    - Upgrade Assoc earlier to steal donations
    - Your Species 5 is delayed
    - Oppo BS Monkey can leech very well
    - Not worth to unlock snap for yet, and unlock $5 is not too high prio
Move #167 Verify building aviary for Ostrich
    - bad: You ignored that oppo just took Americas PZoo the previous turn; now you might get pilfered by Capuchin...
Move #202 Choices
    > Okay to spend X now, because you would have done `Assoc 4X 2rep Univ -> Animals 5U` to spend an X anyways
    > Oppo Read: Assoc 4 2-Science Univ is most likely, so you likely will win the X from BREAK
        > Post Mortem: You read was wrong; oppo actually caused BREAK
    1. Assoc 5X Species 5 unlock 2-size
        - Superior to unlock $5 because of CP_5 $10, Gala Tortoise Sunbathing, and Silver Lake giving you sufficient income
        - After BREAK, very likely cover draw `Zoo School` or `Rock Monitor`
        - Helps fill map
    2. Assoc 5X Species 5 unlock $5
        - You will play expensive animals like `Gala Tortoise`, although it has Sunbathing
        - Money helps with donations
        - bad: Your next Sponsor action will be bad
        - bad: You will very likely get CP_5 $10, so the income is not as urgent
    3. Assoc 5X Species 5 unlock snap Zoo School or Jungle
        - Okay to spend X now
        - `Assoc 5X snap Zoo School -> Sponsor 5 BR 5` circumvents discarding 2 cards, and make your sponsor action good
        - bad: Snap `Zoo School` and play it cover draw will force you to discard 2 cards, which wastes Sunbathing
        - bad: `Zoo School` might not even be that important; keep spamming Sponsor 5 BR 5 BREAK might be completely fine
        - bad: Oppo leeches `Jungle` quite well
    4. Sponsor 5 BR 5 BREAK
Move #230 Verify X-Sponsor is okay
    - Trading $5 for 1X
    - You about to have way too much money, better delay BREAK
Move #311 Verify Sponsor 5 BR 5 can lead to 4-turn end:

https://boardgamearena.com/9/arknova?table=542805787
Move #0 Starting Hand: [Crested Porcupine, Federal Grants, Expert Asia, Meerkat Den]
    - Verify discard `Indian Rhino` to maximize **Near Good**
    - Keep `Meerkat Den` because 4ap now and Herbivores synergy make 2rep Univ better than Europe PZoo
        - Also allows Europe 4 later
    - Discard `Rhea` because $16 for 5ap no synergy is mediocre plan, and you will have ~$15 for round 1 which is too little
Move #31 Verify Expert Asia pav placement: Is cover $2 optimal?
Move #40 Choices
    1. Cards 5 snap `Native Farms`
        - `Native Farms` triggers `Meerkat Den` and if you upgrade Build to purely maximize by cover rep REP_5 upgrade Cards or Animals, you can gain another 7ap from empty borders, potentially even more if you delay.
    2. Cards 5 snap `Boa Constrictor`
        - bad: Don't want to lock into Reptile project yet while Europe and Pred projects are still open
    3. Cards 5 draw 3
        - Value from `Crested Porcupine`, so you essentially see 5 cards
Move #46 Verify X-Build before Animals is the right choice
    - You want Build before Animals
    - `Build 1 [kiosk]` would reduce 1ap from Native Farms
    - X-Build might allow Cards 5X soon, or for **Future Good**
Move #68 Verify only digging `Migration Recording`
    - For now, only oppo might can use this card
Move #79 (Critical) Choices
    1. Cards 5X draw 3
        - **Believe in the Heart of the Cards**
        - Open for any playable animal of Herb, Europe, Pred, Reptile, maybe Asia or Petting
        - Allows you to do project easier
        - You have $30 on Silver Lake, so mostly animals will be playable to you
        - If you fail to find playable animal, `X-Animals -> Sponsor 5 Native Farms` for 11ap is backup plan
        - bad: Only 31 playable animals of [Herb, Europe, Pred, Reptile], 14 more from [Asia, Petting]
            - 59.49% or 45.52% chance or not drawing good playable animal
    2. Cards 5X snap Mountain Tapir
        - Mountain Tapir synergizes with Meerkat Den
        - Mountain Tapir guarantees an animal to play next Round, for **Near Good**
        - Oppo likely will do Sponsor 3X BR 3 BREAK, which burns one X from him, and you have natural follow-up actions
        - Upgrade Cards can solve your hand issue
            - You want to upgrade Cards early anyways to chase projects
        - bad: You set yourself very behind on projects
        - bad: Upgrade Cards means no upgrade Animals, but could be okay since you will already be sitting at REP_5
    3. Cards 4 draw 2
        - bad: If you don't draw a playable animal immediately, you are screwed
    4. X-Assoc -> X-Animals
        - bad: You want to delay BREAK here, so you can't do Cards 5...
Move #99 Verify Build 5 [Petting cover $6, kiosk, pav cover rep REP_5 upgrade Animals]
    > Post-mortem: You forgot about upgrade Assoc and donate twice for CP_2 upgrade!
    > Post-mortem: Strike a fine balance between playing around stuff too much or too little, in this case oppo drawing Petting
    - Aim REP_8 worker
    - Oppo needs to spend rep-draw to deny DISPLAY_2 Petting
    - bad: No Cards upgrade when you need cards
Move #127 No need to Sponsor 5 BR 5 to advance BREAK
    > Post-mortem: Wrong! You can do Europe 2 with Moose
    - Oppo has low income so he wants BREAK as well
    - You have no projects; no need to prioritize Assoc, and you rather want more time to draw cards
    - Oppo might also waste 2 Assoc strength if he does Assoc 5 PZoo
    - If break keeps delaying, you can still do `Build 4 [2 near rock cover $2, kiosk cover draw Mountain Tapir, pav near kiosk] maximize Native Farms -> Animals N Mountain Tapir`
    - You want to play more sponsors anyways, including `Expert Small` and esp. `Native Farms`
    - `Expert Small` 2ap gives $$$1, and discounts `Mountain Tapir`
    - bad: Oppo can better Assoc sequencing than you
Move #137 (Critical) Verify snap `Moose` to aim Europe 2 and synergizes `Meerkat Den`, then Build for `Mountain Tapir` or `GL Tamarin` this round
    - Planning to do Assoc 4 2-Science upgrade Cards, and give up CP_8 Univ
    - At this point, drawing single Pred or Reptile can be awkward for you, so you don't actually have that many good draws, esp. since `Native Farms` accelerates the game
Move #167 (Critical) Verify X-Assoc is better than Sponsor 4 BR 4
    - Since oppo just put Sponsors at 1, BREAK won't occur for at least 2 more turns, and that is if oppo did inefficient `Card 3 -> Build 3 -> Sponsor 3 BR 3 BREAK` or similar
    - No hurries to priortize Assoc, because you only have one worker, and Europe 2 is not ready yet
    - 13ap `Native Farms` this round also gives you $$$4, so you still got your $4 => think of it as "Determination" saving a full Sponsor 4 BR 4 action
    - Saves an X from doing `Build 5 -> Sponsor 5X Native Farms -> Animals 5U Moose` later, not to mention X-Assoc gives you a 2nd X
    - bad: lose 2ap from `Native Farms`
Move #189.a. Was it correct to snap `Native Lizards` to deny oppo ~9pt?
    - Since Pred and Reptiles are kinda useless for you, Cards 5 draw 3 is less appealing
    - You are about to Assoc 5 unlock snap
    - Oppo only has 2 confirmed Reptiles, might be possible to deny him 4th Reptile even
    - Verify that it's more important to snap `Native Lizards` than `Expert Herb`
Move #189.b. If oppo delay BREAK, is Cards 1 draw 1 really the play?
Move #224 Should you unlock snap and snap `Tas Devil`?
    - Unlock snap for project, playable animals, Petting, denial
    - No need to unlock worker because you will BREAK soon, or you will get REP_8 worker
    - `Tas Devil` is $10 for 6ap 1rep, and you have no playable animals for now, and you have chance to play it this round
    - After snap `Tas Devil`, oppo is still out-of-rep for `Komodo Dragon`, and if he draws `Capuchin` to put `Komodo Dragon` in display range, he can only choose either Asia or Americas PZoo
Move #250 Verify: No need to deny `Capuchin` because income is a non-issue, and you likely to Sponsor 5 BR 5 next round?
Move #269 Mistake! Should have saved a spot for Aviary

Move #1 Starting Hand
    > Post Mortem: You completely dismissed the line of Europe 2 because Euro Bison gives a 3rd icon, but giving up one icon is still worth it.
    > Americas PZoo is the most likely PZoo to be taken by oppo
    1. [Wallaby, Goat, Jaguar, Euro Bison]
        - Petting Zoo synergy
        - Taking double Univ is better than taking double PZoo, as you get two upgrades, and potential for REP_8 worker
        - Even if you play `Jaguar` and not have `Sponsorship: Lions`, you can just break 5. On Harbor, you have lots of money anyways
            - `Sponsorship: Lions` also accelerates BREAK, so it's good if oppo wanted to stall
        - Helps `Small Animal Zoo`, esp. when `Climbing Park` is bad
    2. [Barbary Macaque, Jaguar, Sponsorship: Lions, Euro Bison]
        - `Barbary Macaque` pilfer is strong
        - bad: `Barbary Macaque` forces you to take Africa PZoo, which goes against all three base projects, and going three PZoo for 2nd worker means you will only upgrade Assoc for a long time...
        - bad: Rare chance of oppo having `Quaratine Lab`, or simply have below 5ap
        - If Americas PZoo is taken, both `Jaguar` and `Sponsorship: Lions` become too slow, and you likely will have to sell both
Move #5 Choices
    > Post Mortem: Consider **Prebuild** -- could have built Petting instead of pav
        - However, you would have to delay two turns before starting to sell cards
    1. Build 5 [5 cover draw deck] for Euro Bison
        - Can do Europe 2 next round for worker or snap
        - Euro Bison can draw four, which is huge on harbor
        - You get double upgrades without doing an Animals 5U
        - You actually have more ap in this line, than single or zero Petting
        - You can still play Petting later
        - You will have plenty of sponsors to play => not forced to keep BREAKing
        - mid: BREAK is delayed
        - bad: Europe 5 is gone, wasting one Europe icon
        - bad: You have low rep, which nerfs Cards U
        - bad: Sponsors is sequenced back
    2. Build 3 [Petting connect Harbor cover draw]
Move #14 Choices {5 turns}
    [Delay Animals to play around pilfer]
    1.a. Build 1 [pav connect Harbor] sell 1 -> Assoc 4 Europe PZoo sell 1 -> Cards 4 draw 2 sell 1 -> Animals 4 Euro Bison magnet 3-4 sponsors sell 1 -> Sponsor 5 Geologist or Native Seabirds sell 1 -> (Sold 5 cards) {Sponsor Animals Cards Assoc Build BR2 3-4H 0X 1rep 8ap 0CP =-6pt $15 K$$0 $$$11}
        - If oppo wants to pilfer, he has to awkwardly delay Animals 5
    [Prioritize Sponsors; delays Cards]
    1.b. Build 1 [pav connect Harbor] sell 1 -> Assoc 4 Europe PZoo sell 1 -> Animals 3 Euro Bison magnet 3-4 sponsors sell 1 -> Sponsor 5 Geologist or Native Seabirds sell 1 -> Cards 5 sell 1 -> (Sold 5 cards) {Cards Sponsor Animals Assoc Build BR2 2-4H 0X 1rep 8ap 0CP =-6pt $15 K$$0 $$$11}
        - **Polarized**: If oppo causes BREAK, you would have rather sold more cards; if oppo delays BREAK, then Build before Assoc doesn't matter
        - Allows you to sell one more card than (1.)
        - Disguise that you are not doing a Round 1 release
        - Disguise taking Europe PZoo before oppo Cards 5
    [Delay Animals to play around pilfer]
    2. Assoc 4 Europe PZoo -> Cards 4 draw 2 -> Build 3 [pav connect Harbor] sell 1 -> Animals 4 Euro Bison magnet 3-4 sponsors sell 1 -> Sponsor 5 Geologist or Native Seabirds sell 1 -> (Sold 3 cards) {Sponsor Animals Build Cards Assoc BR2 5-6H 0X 1rep 8ap 0CP =-6pt $9 K$$0 $$$11} 
        - If oppo wants to pilfer, he has to awkwardly delay Animals 5
        - Sequences Cards before Build, Animals, and Sponsor
            - BUT, you would have to do Build and Animals before Cards in the current round, if no BREAK
        - bad: excess cards before selling if BREAK
    [Prioritize Sponsors; delays Cards]
    3. Assoc 4 Europe PZoo -> Build 2 [pav (or kiosk) connect Harbor] sell 1 (-1H +1ap +$1 +$$$1) -> Animals 3 Euro Bison magnet 3-4 sponsors sell 1 (+1H/+2H +6ap -$10 +$$$4) -> Sponsor 5 Geologist or Native Seabirds sell 1 (-2H +$3) -> Cards 5 sell 1 (BR2 +1H/0H +$3) -> (Sold 4 cards) {Cards Sponsor Animals Build Assoc BR2 3-5H 0X 1rep 8ap 0CP =-6pt $12 K$$0 $$$11}
        - Only wastes on turn before selling cards
        - Sequencing Assoc before Build allows you to easily do Assoc 5 Europe 2 upgrade Build -> Build 5U next round
Move #38 Cards 4 before Animals 3 Euro Bison
    - Plays around oppo pilfer and Constriction
    - Priortizes Cards over Animals and Sponsors
    - bad: Can't snap whatever shows up after Euro Bison refreshed display
        - but: You have 3 good cards to keep for next round already
Move #45 Verify Build 3 [Petting] to play around oppo attack is worth it
Move #56 Verify Build 1 [kiosk]
	- Plays around pilfer, or make oppo actions awkward
	- More reason to skip Build upgrade
		- If you plan to play both Petting animals and cover buy sponsor, you might not have sufficient money to do a full Build anyways
		- Even if you upgrade Build later, the kiosk doesn't really hinder your other kiosks
	- When everyone is richer, pilfer is less impactful
Move #64 Verify `Animals 4 Euro Bison` playing into pilfer and/or Constriction is okay
Move #91 Choices
	1. Sponsor 5 Native Seabirds sell 1
		- If oppo delays BREAK, I will `Animals 2 Goat` to pwn him
		- Sequences Sponsor before Build
		- Saves the buy sponsor spot for later, such as buying `Expert Europe`
		- Saves $5 at the cost of K$$1 and $$$1
	2. Build 2 [kiosk cover buy Native Seabirds] sell 1
		- Gives one more ap for +$$$1
		- bad: Only builds a single kiosk
		- bad: That kiosk will only give you K$$1 for the next two rounds
Move #102 Choices (Critical)
	1. Assoc 5 unlock snap `Expert Europe`, Europe 2 CP_2 upgrade Cards? (+1H +2CP) -> Cards 5 draw Chameleon? + 3, sell 1 (BR2 +2H +$3) -> Build N=2?

		> Cannot snap `Reptile Breeding` because you don't have the PZoo
		+ Snap *pseudo-upgrade*
			+ Snap more important when you at REP_1
			+ On Harbor, snap is insured at $3
		+ Upgrade Cards is great, and insured at $3
		+ Can cover buy `Expert Europe` efficiently
		+ High appeal gameplay
		+ You wanna draw more cards to allow Wallaby pouch
		+ You might snap or draw a project for CP_5
		+ `Expert Europe` 1-size can be handy later, esp. when no Build upgrade
		- High appeal means susceptible to attacks, and likely missing 25- ap sponsors although `Native Lizards` and `Native Seabirds` are gone
	2. Assoc 5 unlock worker, Europe 2 CP_2 upgrade Build? -> Cards 5 snap Reptile Breeding -> Build 5 cover draw Chameleon sell 1
		+ Gets 2nd upgrade this round
		+ Likely saves 3+ sequence on Assoc even if you fast BREAK
		- Since `Reptile Breeding` can only be played next round, you have to sell one Petting or Dugong
		- Takes you away from Australia PZoo
		- Delays your Snap *pseudo-upgrade*
		- Wastes a full Cards 5 to snap a card while on Harbor, and is upgrading Build over Cards
		- Oppo has opportunity to deny Chameleon right before your Build
		- You will likely do `Sponsor 5 BR 5 BREAK` anyways, so getting 2nd worker has less value
		- Will be at 17 instead of 23 appeal

		- Oppo could draw `Explorer` anyways; but now you allow him to also draw `White Rhino`, while he has 5-hand Univ
Move #18 Sell `Sumatran Tiger` over `Foreign Institute`
	+ Without `Foreign Institut`, you have zero Science icon for `Sumatran Tiger`
		+ CP_5 Univ is too far away
		+ No Science icon no display
	+ You will have no sponsor cards after playing `Ornithologist` `Sponsoship: Lions`
	+ You might cover buy `Foreign Institute` in some lines

   - If you upgrade Sponsors, less urgency to cover buy sponsor, and the empty spaces for a 3-size comes in handy
   - If you upgrade Build, you can reach buy sponsor anyways
Move #44 Post-Mortem of previous move: Consider X-Assoc before Animals 5
Move #67 Selling `Pond Turtle`, because `Explorer` is more important (Critical)
	> Post-Mortem: **Blunder!!** You forgot selling one card gives you $3, so you actually have $33
		- Habitats 5 is 18pt swing and CP_5 Univ
	+ You only have $30 next round, but you need $31 for `Build 5 [2, 1, kiosk, pav] -> Animals 5 Mountain Tapir + Pond Turle`
	+ You might not even draw `Expert Africa`, meaning you can only do Sponsors 5 BR5 while you have 2nd worker
		+ If you Build to draw `Expert Africa`, you can't get REP_5 upgrade
	+ `Mountain Tapir` Digging 2 helps you find 5th icon for Habitats 5

	- Discard `Basic Research` because of **near good**
	- Discard `Raccoon` over `Fennec Fox`, because it's cheaper and Clever is more flexibile, although you lose a Bear icon
Move #13 Is `Water Playground` @a5b6 optimal?

		- Loses $6 from not taking Australiz PZoo
	2. Assoc 5 Australia PZoo -> Cards 5 snap Savanna -> Animals 5 Wombat pouch Fennec Fox
		- Will only have two upgrades, forced to be Animals + Assoc
		- Forced to take 3rd PZoo for worker, meaning you will have 3 workers too early
Move #70 Verify upgrade Cards over Sponsors
	+ You badly need draws for next animals and projects
	+ You will get 3rd upgrade very soon anyways, if you will need to play upgraded Sponsor card
	+ You have 5-hand Univ
	- Cannot play `Expert Large` from display, but you can draw them. And remember not to replenish display too often!
		- `Cable Car` is unplayable due to Build restrictions
Move #82 Verify drawing `Cable Car` + `Expert Large` instead of from deck
	- `Expert Large` gives 2ap for `Fur Seal` and saves $4 from `Golden Eagle`
	- `Golden Eagle` triggers `Cable Car`
Move #92 Do `Fur Seal` before `Expert Large`
	+ *Near Good*: You gain 2ap when you would only have 11ap after releasing `Fur Seal`, which means +$$$1
	- Might lose one X-token when doing `Sponsors 5 Cable Car -> Animals 5 Golden Eagle` later, or lose 2ap
		- But, you will likely blind build 3-size_water, then do Cards. You might play another animal before Golden Eagle
		- But, oppo might do `Sponsor 4 Ornithologist` which delays BREAK
	- You lose $4 from `Expert Large`, but it's actually only $3 for 2ap because you will have +$$$1
Move #111 Verify unlock $5, upgrade Build
Move #156 Verify draw Primate Breeding over Jungle for Guereza
	+ `Primate Breeding` is more immediately value
	+ You have empty 2-size and 1-size hanging around, don't need the empty 3-size as much
	+ Not releasing Primate preserves change for Primates 5/4
Move #162 Verify upgrade Sponsors and you won’t be left with too much excess money 
Move #177 Was `Cards 3X snap Euro Bison` urgent enough?
	+ Fight for Europe 5 is critical, and is also *near*
	+ Shut down scary oppo line: `Assoc 5 Release Predator: Tas. Deveil, snap Euro Bison -> Animals 5U double Petting`
	+ Soon, you will `Assoc 5 Habitats 3 unlock 2-size cover Clever down Cards`. Nice when you already have many good cards, and you're trying to Build more to fill map
	+ At least you boost up Assoc which is important
	- Really poor sequencing; basically wasting a turn
Move #229 Sponsors 4 Baboon Rock or Assoc 2rep?
	> Verify Baboon Rock fill map is better than leaving space for 5-size; you have enough to END
	+ Guessing oppo will delay BREAK, Sponsors 4 Baboon Rock allows you to play Geologist soon after
	+ You need to play more animals before a good Assoc 5 anyways
Move #238 Do Animals 5U before Assoc N 2rep
	+You need to play another animal before good Assoc 5 project
	- Counter-argument is to do Assoc 4 2-Science Univ soon, but that's only 1CP
Move #249 Choices
	{4 turns}
	1. X-Build -> Sponsors 4X BR 4 -> Animals 3 -> Assoc 5 project
		+ In 4 turns, you have already done Animals and Assoc 5 => very efficient!
		+ Waiting on `Geologist` might net you +3ap, and it's your last Sponsors when you don't have unlock snap => more flexibility
			+ With upgraded Sponsors on Hollywood, you might play double sponsors with `Geologist` + sth
			+ You have already covered all rock spaces for `Geologist`; no reason to play it early
			+ Using `Geologist` to stall next round makes more sense, when you can use 3 workers for double project of Europe 5 + Primate Breeding
		- Lose out on some rep
	{4 turns}
	2. Assoc 4 2rep -> Sponsors 3 Geologist -> X-Build -> {Build Sponsors Assoc Animals Cards 8H 3X} -> Sponsors 4XX BR 4 || X-Cards
		+ Due to Favorite Zoo, priortize rep
		- You will do `Primate Breeding` and `CT Tamarin` anyways, so rep is not as much of an issue
		- Assoc 4 2rep hurts your Assoc sequencing a lot; not advised when you already have two project, and display shows two more playable projects

	+ If you draw a small Repile, both `Waza Small` and `Sponsorship: Reptiles` could be useful
	+ `Science Lab` is strong if you manage to upgrade Sponsors

		+ `Penguin Pool` helps with Habitats 5
			+ Note that if you try Primates 2 or Reptiles 2, you deviate from Habitats 5
			+ Also denies oppo from having it
		+ `Penguin pool` might help with Aquatic Park
		> Double Univ already gives you two upgrades; same number of upgrades as if you do double PZoo + project
		+ Double Univ will give you 5-hand next, which is nice
		+ CP_8 PZoo => Univ start slightly better
		+ More map coverage also accelerates completion of ICP
		- Oppo can pilfer you instead, if he takes another PZoo nexr round
			+ You will be at 0CP, so `JP Macaque` can pilfer at most one
			+ Since it's next round, you will have time to prepare

	> Action: Sponsors 4 Science Lab draw Capuchin ~> oppo BREAK, rep-draw Release Americas -> Assoc 5 Americas PZoo -> Build 5 [2 near kiosk cover X] -> Animals 5 Capuchin pilfer
	+ *Essentially*, Clever down Assoc will mean you will squeeze in Cards 5, then the exact same sequence

	+ You are lining up Assoc -> Cards -> Sponsors ~> BREAK -> Assoc

	> Oppo might or might not play JP Macaque to prepare Primates 2
	> Possibly delay BREAK if oppo is also out of gas, but only if you can play a useful sponsor
	> Draw more cards to mitigate JP Macaque pilfer
	+ In case oppo steals Primates 2 after playing JP Macaque, you can still do Release Americas: Capuchin
		+ Even if you do Primates 2, it's still a direction for future project
	+ Doesn't hurt ICP completion much, as you can go the bottom route
	+ Leaves more spaces for empty 5-size after ICP completion
	- -K$$1
		+ Since you will likely Sponsor 5 BR 5 +$10, losing -K$$1 is more okay
	- Have to discard one card
		+ `Waza Small` or `Sponsorship: Reptiles` is fine to discard
	- Delay cover +1X
		- You might still not cover it next round, due to ICP completion plan..
		+ You don't have immediate need for X yet, and likely `Sponsor 5 BR 5 BREAK` next round will give you an X
	- Oppo can leech Release Americas with large/medium animal later
		+ You really want to do project by Round 3; *Near Good > Future Good*
		+ You can avoid playing it, if you get to support Primates 2

		+ If oppo grief-take Americas PZoo, you can still take 5-hand Univ upgrade Cards
	{4 turns}
	2. Cards 3 draw 2 discard 1 -> Sponsors 3 BR 3 BREAK -> Assoc 5 Americas PZoo -> Animals 5 Capuchin pilfer -> {Animals Assoc Sponsors Cards Build}
		+ You see two more cards
		- But you already keeping `Capuchin` and `Release Americas`, and you low-key want to keep `Sponsorship: Reptiles` since Reptiles 4 is a project
		- You will have 3-hand this round and next
		- `Science Lab` will draw during BREAK
Move #83 Choice of discard
	1. `Sponsorship: Reptiles`
		+ If you play a reptile next, `Sponsorship: Reptiles` arguably has more upside
			- Income less important on ICP, with upgraded Sponsors
			+ Income good without upgraded Build yet
	2. `Waza Small`
		+ Since you are missing the trinity of Herbivore, Predator, Bear icons for Species 5, as well as Petting, `Waza Small` snap comes in handy
			+ Species 10 is 10-pt swing, and remember CP_5 $10 and CP_8 PZoo
			+ You are trying to draw agressively for Species 5, which makes `Waza Small` snap more prioritized
			+ You have no playable animal after `Capuchin`, so might want `Waza Small` snap more
		+ `Reptiles` and `Primates` are small; both fit a base project
		+ `Waza Small` is already playable, in case you want to delay BREAK
		+ `Waza Small` can facilitate a big point jump to END
		- `Waza Small` anti-synergy with `Large Animal Zoo`
Move #93 Choices (Critical)
	1. Assoc 5 Americas PZoo
		+ Does not rely on draw, thus cannot brick
			 + You are confident to be a better player. Should rely less on luck
		+ Playing Capuchin insures the possibility of Assoc 5 unlock worker next round, guaranteeing you to be able to stay in round longer and spam Sponsors next round
		+ You lose Build upgrade this round, but you will have clear path to *all* upgrades compared to stuck with Build-only for a while
		+ Enables immediate Capuchin pilfer
			+ Pilfer threat could hinder oppo play, esp. when he wants to do Animals before Cards
			+ If he build, I can pilfer immediately before he draws
			- His JP Macaque can pilfer twice later
			+ But you can be more prepated to give away cards
			+ Pilfer is stronger when you play it earlier
		+ If you pilfer and oppo gives you money, then he is so poor that he needs to BREAK a lot, meaning completing ICP later is okay
		- Loses 5-hand
			+ Release Americas is the only card you really want to carry to next round, and you have `Science Lab` passive, so should be fine
		- You do miss out on a fantastic Build opportunity
	2. Assoc 5 5-hand Univ upgrade Build -> Cards 5 draw 3? (BR2 +2H) -> Build 5U
		+ Expect to complete ICP faster by one round, estimating $3 + $5+ = $8+
			- If you can't play Capuchin, and brick, then you will be at 9ap which also loses some income
			- You already have Federal Grants, so it's less important
	3. Assoc 5 5-hand Univ upgrade Animals -> ...
		+ Aim REP_8 worker
		- If you brick on draw, you look extremely dumb
	4. Cards 5X draw 3 (BR2 -1X +2H)
		+ Flexibility
			+ Draw before deciding which Univ to take
		- Lose -1X, and sequence Assoc behind Cards, which estimates as -2X total
			- Bad when you likely unlock worker next round and spam Assoc
Move #102 Choices
	1. X-Build
		+ No urgency to Build this round
		+ Saves 1 more X from `Sponsors 3X Federal Grants`
		+ If you manage to play double sponsors using the extra X, then you can squeeze in Sponsors N BR N for $2N
			+ Also, X can be spent as $2 on Sponsors BR action as a backup plan
			- Oppo seems to slow play often, so you have slightly more chances to gain X
		+ Since you are going bottom path to complete ICP, you won't cover X for some time
		+ With the extra X, there is some universe where you can squeeze a `Sponsors NX*` before having to discard
	2. Build 4 [pav near kiosk] (-$2 +1ap +K$$1)
		> You will have Federal Grants and upgraded Sponsors for income, but delayed ICP and oppo JP Macaque pilfer threat
		+ Expect +K$$1 +$$$1 total after playing `Capuchin` for +5ap
			+ Due to the nature of ICP, this +K$$1 likely won't hinder future kiosk optimizations
			+ This is *Near Good*
			- You are spending $2 now to gain +$$2, so there is no immediate help for next round, and for future rounds you might already have sufficient income on ICP
		+ Saves 1 more X from `Sponsors 3X Federal Grants`
		+ You already have 2Xs; okay to forgo 1X
		- Chance to make yourself a pilfer target by having just enough ap
			- If oppo has any Petting, then this is likely
			- On the contrary, if you have 2CP and lower ap, you might induce oppo to play JP Macaque for only Pilfer 1
			- Playing a small 3ap animal now is arguably oppo's nutted action, so since you are confident as better player you should play around that
	3. Sponsors 3X Federal Grants
		+ Priortize Sponsors so using X is not too bad
	4. Animals 3 Capuchin pilfer
		> No hurry to play Capuchin
		- Oppo just `Cards 4 draw 2`, now with 4 cards on 3-hand, so he can more afford to give away card
			- Better to wait for him to Build, then pilfer
		- Care too high ap for oppo JP Macaque
	5. Cards 5 draw 3
	- Oppo can Sponsors 5XX BREAK and make you discard 3 cards
Move #106 Choices
	1. Animals 4 Capuchin pilfer -> Sponsors 4 Federal Grants
		+ If oppo has 2-size animal costing $12 or more, this pilfer gives him a really tough decision
			+ If you don't pilfer now and he plays the animal, then he can give you card with less fear of messing up his own plan
			- Out of 13 candidate animals, only 2 become unplayable with $12
			- Oppo `Platypus` will hit you, `Common Wombat` pouch 1 or `Malayan Tapir` digging 3 signals you to pilfer later
				+ But, it's an Herbivore which does not help any base project for oppo
				+ Even with `Platypus`, since oppo about to BREAK, it's less bad for you
			+ Oppo `Caracal` and `Rhea` will gain cards, which signals you to pilger now
				+ Moreover, they help oppo for Species 5
		- Wastes one upgraded Sponsor sequence
			+ More okay when you already have 3Xs
	2. Sponsors 3 Federal Grants
	3. Cards 5 draw 3
		- Oppo can still Sponsor 5X BR 5 BREAK to make you discard 3 cards, before playing his animal
Move #126 Should you `BREAK draw `Hydrologist` (+1H) -> Sponsors 2X DISPLAY_2 `Sponsorship: Primates` (-1X +2ap -$2 +$$$3) -> Cards 5`?
		> `Sponsorship: Primates` is strong due to Primates base CP, but weaker due to both upgraded Sponsors and on ICP
		> Even if oppo Build 3 to rush Primates 2, you are still one turn faster
		+ `Hydrologist` + `Sponsorship: Primates` already give enough points to offset Reptiles 4 vs Reptiles 2
			+ Reptiles 4 also forces you to find and play a lot more Reptiles; there is opportunity cost
			+ You might still have 3-hand by end of round, can't risk keeping too many cards in hand
			+ *Near Good* > *Future Good*
			+ `Hydrologist` will give a good bit of money; also helps `Aquatic Park` vs `Large Animal Zoo`
		+ Using your upgraded Sponsors well, and hindering oppo upgraded Sponsors
		+ You prepare to give away cards to oppo JP Macaque, so makes more sense to play your good cards now instead of keeping for late game
			+ Maybe just let him pilfer you now, and get it over with; could be harder to give away cards later, when you are even more committed
			+ `Waza Small` is easy giveaway; `Release Americas` is okay giveaway; even `Hydrologist` is not too bad giveaway
		+ Oppo also should aim Primates 5, so if he also wants Reptiles 4 he will be distracted
		+ You have $41 and oppo has $34; okay to give money once
			+ `Sponsorship: Primates` straight ap is more important
		- Gives oppo chance to draw all Reptiles
			+ Oppo might just upgrade Build
			- Oppo could upgrade Cards and do Assoc 5 unlock 2-size; or, he can cover rep-draw Reptiles twice
		- Seeing one less card from deck
			+ Believe in `Hydrologist` and *Near Good*
		- If you don't gain ap, oppo actually cannot pilfer you the 2nd time
			+ You can all-in on *Near Good*, and gamble by giving away two cards
		- Wastes 1X on Sponsors
		- If you let oppo play `Sponsorship: Primates`, it's harder for him to pilfer you
			+ `Sponsorship: Primates` is enough value to sacrifice one pilfer for
Move #144 Verify `Sponsors 2 DISPLAY_1 GF Research` is always correct

		+ `GF Research` is playable by both players from display for 2rep + 1CP
			+ If you don't play it now, oppo `Build 3 [3_water cover kiosk cover draw]` will draw it away
			+ Deny oppo `Spokesperson` synergy
			+ 4th Science icon for Science Lab endgame
		+ Enables REP_8 worker if you upgrade Animals next 
		+ You already X-Build once, thus unlikely to fill map
		+ If release `Amer Bison`, even less reason to fill map
		+ Able to upgrade all of [Animals, Cards, Assoc], esp. since last_worker 2CP and CP_8 PZoo
		+ Buffs `Waza Small`
		+ You gain a pseudo-upgrade of 2-size, and you still gain 2nd worker
			+ Soon totaling 5 upgrades as opposed to 4
		+ Maximizes `Giraffe` value
		+ Will complete ICP next round if you Build 5-size
		- Less kiosk/pavilion than full Build => you lose -$$$4
			+ But, unlock 2-size ~= +$$$4 with tempo
		- Playing `GF Research` gives oppo option to draw `GL Tamarin`
		- `Amer Bison` can’t be played yet, esp. if oppo likely takes `GL Tamarin`
Move #162 Choices vs pilfer
	1. Give oppo draw + $5?
		+ Denies oppo chance to play `Red Deer`
			+ Esp. good oppo have no empty enclosure
		+ Since both players have 3-hand, good idea to give away cards
			+ Esp. when oppo might `Sponsors 5 BR 5 BREAK` next
			+ Oppo might still not have a project, and thus will block 5-hand Univ next round
			+ Your cards action is coming up soon
		+ 20% good outcome: [Waza Small]
		> 40% neutral outcome: [Hydrologist, Giraffe]
		- 40% bad outcome: [Amer Bison, Release Americas]
			+ If oppo takes `Amer Bison`, at least that card is useless to oppo on its own
			+ If oppo takes `Release Americas`, you can keep `Amer Bison` and hope to leech later
				+ Your `Capuchin` might deceive oppo into thinking it's safe to do `Release Americas_Small`
	2. Give oppo $10
		+ `American Bison` + `Release Americas` is extremely strong
		    - Since you have unlocked 2-size, releasing a empty 5-size back is a slightly less deal
			> It is a *Medium Good*
		+ Oppo playing `Red Deer` from display is guiding him away from Primates and Reptiles base projects
			- `Red Deer` flocks when he has no enclosure
			- Bad reason: he will have ~$36 after BREAK, and he didn't have to build extra for `Red Deer` anyways
			- *Near Good* for oppo
			+ Playing `Red Deer` from display is $15 for 5ap, not even that strong
			+ 28ap vs 23ap is only +$$$1
			+ Allows you to deny both Primates from display after BREAK
		- If he BREAK right afterwards, you have to discard 2 cards anyways...
			+ Unless you immediately do `Sponsors 4XX Hydrologist`

	+ `Medical Breakthrough` gives rep through `Spokesperson`
		+ In some lines, it gives you exactly REP_8
	+ Playing `Medical Breakthrough` gives you an upgrade on BREAK
	+ `Medical Breakthrough` expected to give 2-3CP total
	+ `Medical Breakthrough` allows you to stall when you will have 2nd worker soon, and it's better usage of upgraded sponsors
	+ `Herbivore Breeding` is too slow, and you need to awkwardly take Australia PZoo
	+ You already have Habitats 3 and Species 5/3 available, not scared of running out of projects to do
	+ You will have so many rep anyways; 2rep from `Herbivore Breeding` is less important
	- `Sponsorship: Reptiles` is +1ap, +$$$3

		- Even if you find new Habitat icon, if oppo `Sponsors 5 BR 5 BREAK` next, you have to discard anyways
			- And you tranposes to sequencing Cards behind on Harbor, considering missing +$$$3 from playing Grass Snake

	+ Unlock $5 better when you plan to play `Asian Elephant`
	+ `Herb Breeding` will be after Asia PZoo and `Asian Elephant`, thus it's *Future Good*
	+ Having so much income pressures oppo to cause BREAK, thus I can spam more sponsors

	- Unlock snap is OP
		+ Nothing on display is worth snapping atm
Move #84 Should I Build cover draw Sec Bird > Wolf > deck, over cover $4?

	+ Facilitates `Water Dragon` sunbathe

			+ Even better, because if you draw a 3/4-cost sponsor, you can play it before doing Cards, potentially gain +1X from cause BREAK or delay BREAK
	+ Draw `Sec Bird` deny oppo Aviary synergy, Release Sec Bird high roll, delay Species 5
		+ I can use Aviary synergy myself
		- Aviary weaker on Silver Lake due to Eagles weaker
	- Oppo benefits more from display replenishing
	- Kills one empty 5-size/Aviary/Reptile House slot

	- Draw Wolf deny oppo `Expert Pred` synergy and Release Wolf high roll
		- Oppo upgraded Cards; slightly more likely he wants to draw Wolf

	      + Asian Elephant + donate + Silver Lake Determination means income is worth
	      + Since you haven't upgraded Cards nor unlocked snap, card-draw is a more precious resource => `Sponsor N BR N` saving one card is more worth
	    - Must BREAK before doing Assoc, arguably bad vs oppo `Sponsors 4 Herpetologist -> Animals 5U Macaw + ?? ->. Assoc 4 5-hand Univ`
	    - If you do `Assoc 9XXXX 2-Science Univ + Release Bird` next round, then you will only have one worker left and cannot do another project => you might be "forced" to cause last BREAK
	        + Can do `Assoc 3 PZoo` which might not be the worst
	        + Ibex Jumping 2 also makes this less bad
	    - Will give oppo easy access to Release Bird
	    - Doing Cards allows oppo to BREAK without spending 2Xs

	    > Likely next Assoc unlock snap
	    > If you take `Assoc 5 2-Science Univ` now, then you will likely do `Assoc 8XXX PZoo upgrade Cards + project` later
	        - You prob don't need to upgrade Cards to END
	        - Give 3X = 3endpt via `Expert Africa`, `Assoc 8XXX PZoo upgrade Cards + project` might be worse
	    + Build 5 cover rep gives you REP_8 worker
	    + Can delay BREAK which should benefit you more
	        + Delaying BREAK could allow more X-backs, which helps your `Expert Africa`
	        + You have so many projects to do s.t. you don't mind delaying BREAK
	    + +$$2 compated to Line 1
	    + Unlock snap is very strong in general
	        + Unlock snap can snap a sponsor to play with cover Marketing later
                - You might can END without ever unlocking snap
	    - If oppo BREAK right before you do `Sponsors 5 BR 5`, things could get awkward for you
	    - Loses Ibex which is very valuable
	    - Cannot do `Assoc 9XXXX 2-Science Univ + project`, which is the most efficient way to spend Xs
